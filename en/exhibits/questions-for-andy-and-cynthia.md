Hi!

\--Can I control the order in which users see Archives/Exhibits?\
--Can I change the 'about' text directly in github?\
--Can I control who gets admin control? Would I want to?\
--Can I put videos in as the image? I tried but perhaps did it wrong?\
--how come this text isn't visible when i click on 'read more'?
